- Android SDK (for building APK)
- Java 8 or higher
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iron-tracker-android.git
cd iron-tracker-android
```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install Kivy Garden matplotlib:**
```bash
garden install matplotlib
```

### Building for Android

1. **Install Buildozer:**
```bash
pip install buildozer
```

2. **Initialize buildozer (first time only):**
```bash
buildozer init
```

3. **Build the APK:**
```bash
buildozer android debug
```

4. **For release build:**
```bash
buildozer android release
```

The APK will be generated in the `bin/` directory.

## Database Schema

### iron_readings table
- `id`: Primary key
- `reading_date`: Date of reading
- `reading_time`: Time of reading
- `iron_level`: Iron level value (Œºg/dL)
- `unit`: Unit of measurement
- `notes`: Optional notes
- `test_type`: Type of iron test
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### user_profile table
- `id`: Primary key
- `age`: User age
- `gender`: User gender
- `normal_range_min`: Minimum normal iron level
- `normal_range_max`: Maximum normal iron level
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

## Customization

### Normal Range Values
The app uses these default normal ranges:
- **General Adult Range**: 60-170 Œºg/dL

You can customize these values in the Insights tab based on your healthcare provider's recommendations.

### Adding New Test Types
To add new iron test types, modify the `test_types` list in `screens/input_screen.py`:

```python
test_types = [
    "Serum Iron",
    "Transferrin Saturation", 
    "Ferritin",
    "TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity)",
    "UIBC (Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity)",
    "Your New Test Type"  # Add here
]
```

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
cd iron_tracker
python main.py
```

### Code Structure
- **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation between data (database), views (screens), and logic
- **Material Design**: Uses KivyMD for modern Android UI components
- **Modular Design**: Each screen is a separate module for maintainability
